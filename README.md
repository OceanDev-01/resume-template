### <samp>✨ Description</samp>

> <samp>This repository contains a resume template that will help you keep your information in a sophisticated, elegant and minimalist format that is easy to read for recruiters and ATS systems.</samp>

### <samp>📑 Resume</samp>

> *<samp>"I am a markdown lover and professionally we can also take advantage of this type of language when creating our resume."</samp>*

<samp>Personally a few moments ago I had to update my resume and as someone who likes to take notes only with plain text I have given myself the task of taking advantage of my taste for markdown and as a programmer I am to make this new update.<samp>

### <samp>📝 Format</samp>

<samp>Nowadays, there is a world of possibilities when it comes to creating a resume, the format of it generally depends on your profession, have the resume as a web page, printed with an extravagant design, avant-garde, sophisticated, simple or minimalist, however, nowadays there is more use of ATS systems that help recruiters to read the candidate's information, these types of resumes include a good header with the ideal contact information that is needed immediately, keywords that correspond to the application or job offer to which you are applying, and a clear structure with a simplified one-page design without columns.</samp>

`Note:` <samp>It is not absolutely necessary for this type of resume to include a photograph.</samp>

### <samp>🔰 Important</samp>

<samp>For those who have a notion of using markdown I share a template so you can edit it and then export it as PDF, however, thinking of you, you who have no idea how to use this type of language, I will be attaching the template also in PDF format so you can make use of this template.</samp>

> *<samp>I hope you find it useful, I wish you a lot of success..!!</samp>*
